# Homework-Management
A homework manager that helps you remember and do you homework 

# Features
The features that are in the project are
- [x] Password Hashing
- [ ] Due Work (With Notifictions)
- [ ] Smart Setup (Walks you through setting up this)
- [ ] Connect to Schoolbox (https://schoolbox.com.au/) (Will need to Scrap it)
- [ ] Connect to Google Classroom
- [ ] OAuth with Google, Office 365 & Facebook

# How to run it
- Install Node.js (and npm)
- Clone the project
- Run `npm install`
- Open `.env.example` and fill it out (you need a postgresql database for `DATAURI` & pick a random number for `SALTROUNDS`)
- Run `npm start` and go to http://localhost:3000

**For the Databse you will need to make a database from what you see (use your programmer intuition). I'll create a script for this one day**
